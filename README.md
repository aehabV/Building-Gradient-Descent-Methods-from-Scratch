# Building-Gradient-Descent-Methods-from-Scratch
Implemented optimization algorithms, including Momentum, AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam, from scratch using only NumPy in Python. Implemented the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) optimizer and conducted a comparative analysis of its results with those obtained using Adam.
